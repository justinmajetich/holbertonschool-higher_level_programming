#### Task 2: [2-args.py]
* Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments

#### Task 3: [3-infinite_add.py]
* Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments

#### Task 5: [5-variable_load.py]
* Write a program that imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value

#### Task 6 (Advanced): [100-my_calculator.py]

#### Task 7 (Advanced): [101-easy_print.py]
* Write a program that prints `#pythoniscool`, followed by a new line, in the standard output
#### Task 8 (Advanced): [102-magic_calculation.py]
* Write the Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b):` that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
