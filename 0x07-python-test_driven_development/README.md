# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

This directory contains files created in response to tasks set forth in Holberton student project "0x07. Python - Test-driven development". These Python scripts serve to demonstrate an implementation of test files - the latter of which are located in the `tests/` directory.

#### Task 0: [0-add_integer.py, tests/0-add_integer.txt]
* Write a function that adds 2 integers
#### Task 1: [2-matrix_divided.py, tests/2-matrix_divided.txt]
* Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix
#### Task 2: [3-say_my_name.py, tests/3-say_my_name.txt]
* Write a function that prints `My name is <first name> <last name>`
#### Task 3: [4-print_square.py, tests/4-print_square.txt]
* Write a function that prints a square with the character `#`
#### Task 4: [5-text_indentation.py, tests/5-text_indentation.txt]
* Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: `.`, `?` and `:`
#### Task 5: [tests/6-max_integer_test.py]
* In this task, you will write unittests for the function `def max_integer(list=[])`

#### Task 6 (Advanced): [100-matrix_mul.py, tests/100-matrix_mul.txt]
* Write a function that multiplies 2 matrices
