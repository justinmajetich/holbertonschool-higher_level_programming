#### Task 1: [1-number_of_lines.py]
* Write a function that returns the number of lines of a text file
#### Task 2: [2-read_lines.py]
* Write a function that reads `n` lines of a text file (`UTF8`) and prints it to stdout
#### Task 3: [3-write_file.py]
* Write a function that writes a string to a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters written
#### Task 4: [4-append_write.py]
* Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters added
#### Task 5: [5-to_json_string.py]
* Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string)
#### Task 6: [6-from_json_string.py]
* Write a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string
#### Task 7: [7-save_to_json_file.py]
* Write a function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation
#### Task 8: [8-load_from_json_file.py]
* Write a function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”
#### Task 9: [9-add_item.py]
* Write a script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file
#### Task 10: [10-class_to_json.py]
* Write a function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object
#### Task 11 : [11-student.py]
*  Write a class `Student` that defines a student by
#### Task 12 : [12-student.py]
*  Write a class `Student` that defines a student by: (based on `11-student.py`)
#### Task 13 : [13-student.py]
*  Write a class `Student` that defines a student by: (based on `12-student.py`)
#### Task 14 : [14-pascal_triangle.py]
*  Create a function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of `n`
#### Task 15 (Advanced): [100-append_after.py]
* Write a function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string
#### Task 16 (Advanced): [101-stats.py]
