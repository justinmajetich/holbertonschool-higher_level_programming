# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This directory contains files created in response to tasks set forth in Holberton student project "0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples". The following tasks demonstrate a basic introduction to data structures in Python.

#### Header File: [lists.h]

#### Task 0: [0-print_list_integer.py]
* Write a function that prints all integers of a list
#### Task 1: [1-element_at.py]
* Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C
#### Task 2: [2-replace_in_list.py]
* Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C)
#### Task 3: [3-print_reversed_list_integer.py]
* Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order
#### Task 4: [4-new_in_list.py]
* Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C)
#### Task 5: [5-no_c.py]
* Write a function that removes all characters `c` and `C` from a string
#### Task 6: [6-print_matrix_integer.py]
* Write a function that prints a matrix of integers
#### Task 7: [7-add_tuple.py]
* Write a function that adds 2 tuples
#### Task 8: [8-multiple_returns.py]
* Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character
#### Task 9: [9-max_integer.py]
* Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list
#### Task 10: [10-divisible_by_2.py]
* Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list
#### Task 11: [11-delete_at.py]
* Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list
#### Task 12: [12-switch.py]
* Complete the source code in order to switch value of `a` and `b`
#### Task 13: [13-is_palindrome.c]
* Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome
