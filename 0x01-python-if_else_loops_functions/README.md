# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

This directory contains files created in response to tasks set forth in Holberton student project "0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions". These scripts demonstrate a basic introduction to control and conditional syntax in the Python programming language.

#### Header File: lists.h

#### Task 0: [0-positive_or_negative.py]
* Complete the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_py) in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative

#### Task 1: [1-last_digit.py]
* Complete the [source code](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/e9k9---MJXcMmIjlMdlBpw) in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`

#### Task 2: [2-print_alphabet.py]
* Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line

#### Task 3: [3-print_alphabt.py]
* Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet (except `q` and `e`), in lowercase, not followed by a new line

#### Task 4: [4-print_hexa.py]
* Write a program that prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and in hexadecimal

#### Task 5: [5-print_comb2.py]
* Write a program that prints numbers from `0` to `99`

#### Task 6: [6-print_comb3.py]
* Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits

#### Task 7: [7-islower.py]
* Write a function that checks for lowercase character

#### Task 8: [8-uppercase.py]
* Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line

#### Task 9: [9-print_last_digit.py]
* Write a function that prints the last digit of a number

#### Task 10: [10-add.py]
* Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result

#### Task 11: [11-pow.py]
* Write a function that computes `a` to the power of `b` and return the value

#### Task 12 : [12-fizzbuzz.py]
* Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space

#### Task 13: [13-insert_number.c]
* Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list
